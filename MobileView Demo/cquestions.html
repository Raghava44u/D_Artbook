   <center>C LANGUAGE QUESTIONS </center> 
    0) Why is C called a mid-level programming language? <br>
      ans :-  It is both an assembly-level language, i.e. a low-level language, and a higher-level language<br>
    
    1) who discovered C? and why you choose C language ? what's the purpose of learning the C ? tell me its two uses ?<br>
       ans:- 1) dennisritche <br>
             2)because of C is the best basic language to learn other languages like JAVA, PYTHON, etc.<br>
             3)here the purpose is we can slove the basic problems like we can take an example like ( voter registration, student attendence,etc)<br>
             4)c language  is basic for all orirnted programmes and we slove basic problems in public <br>
    
    
    
    2) how many levels in C language can we clasified ?<br>
       ans :- there are two levels in C LANGUAGE <br>
       THER ARE :1) low level programe<br>
                    we can write INTEGER, FLOAT, CHARACTER, DOUBLE, etc<br>
    
                 2) high level programme<br>
                    we can write ARRAYS( both 1D , 2D ) ,STRINGS,  STRUCTURES , FUNCTIONS, etc<br>
    
    3) WHAT IS DATA TYPE ? HOW MANY DATA TYPES ARE PRESENT?<br>
    
    4)WHAT ARE PREMATIVE DATA TYPES ? <br>
    
    5) WHAT ARE NON-PREMATIVE DATA TYPES ?<br>
    
    
    6)DEFINE VARIABLE ?  HOW MANY TYPES IT CAN CLASSSIFIED ? HOW TO IMPLEMENTS IT ?<br>
    
    7) WHAT IS AN ARRAY ? HOW MANY TYPES IT'S BE CLASSIFIED ? TELL ME ITS ADVANTAGES & DIS ADVANTAGES ?<br>
    
    8) 2. What are the features of the C programming language?<br>
    ans :- middle level laguage<br>
           prosedrual language <br>
           fasts and efficient <br>
           probability<br>
          statically type<br>
          genaral purpose language<br>
    
    9) derived data types are :- function , pointers, array, refrence<br>
    10) user defined data types are :- class , structure union enum typedef<br>
    11) WHAT ARE TOKENS IN C LANGUAGE ?<br>
     ans :-KEY WORDS <br>
    IDENTIFIERS <br>
    CONSTANTS<br>
    STRINGS<br>
    SPECIAL SYMBOLS<br> 
    OPARATORS<br>
    12) WHAT ARE STATIC AND NON-STATIC VARIABLES ?<br>
    
    
    13)10. Write a program to convert a number to a string with the help of sprintf() function in the C library?<br>
    
    14) what is the difference between local and gloabpl vaiabls ?<br>
    
    15) What is recursion in C?<br>
    ans :- <br>
    
    
    
    16)What are pointers and their uses? <br>
    ans :- Pointers are used to store the address of the variable or a memory location. Pointer can also be used to refer to another pointer function. The main purpose of the pointer is to save memory space and increase execution time.<br>
    
    USES :- To pass arguments by reference<br>
    For accessing array elements<br>
    To return multiple values<br>
    Dynamic memory allocation<br>
    To implement data structures<br>
    To do system-level programming where memory addresses are useful<br>
    
    17) What is typedef in C?<br>
    In C programming, typedef is a keyword that defines an alias for an existing type. Whether it is an integer variable, function parameter, or structure declaration, typedef will shorten the name.<br>
    
    18) What are loops and how can we create an infinite loop in C? tell me a basic programme in your words.<br>
    Loops are used to execute a block of statements repeatedly.<br>
    example:<br>
    
    
    19)what is the best keyword for for to write infinite code ?<br>
    
    
    20)What is the difference between type casting and type conversion?<br>
    Type Casting................................ Type Conversion
    
    
                                       
    The data type is converted to another data type by a programmer with the help of a casting operator.<br>
        The data type is converted to another data by a compiler.<br>
    It can be applied to both compatible data types as well as incompatible data types.	Type conversion can only be applied to only compatible data types.<br>
     
    Type casting is more efficient and reliable.	<br>
    Type conversion is less efficient and less reliable than type casting.<br>
    
    21)What are header files and their uses?<br>
    ans :- Header files contain predefined standard library functions. All header files must have a ‘.h’ extension. Header files contain function definitions, data type definitions, and macros which can be imported.<br>
    
    22) What are the functions and their types?<br>
    
    The function is a block of code that is used to perform a task multiple times rather than writing it out multiple times in our program. Functions avoid repetition of code and increase the readability of the program
    User-defined Functions: Functions that are defined by the user to reduce the complexity of big programs. 
    Built-in Functions: Library functions are provided by the compiler package and consist of special functions with special and different meanings. <br>
    
    23) What is a structure?<br>
    The structure is a keyword that is used to create user-defined data types. The structure allows storing multiple types of data in a single unit. <br>
    
    example : Name: Kamlesh_Joshi<br>
    Roll_No: 27 <br>
    Address: Haldwani<br>
    Branch: Computer Science And Engineering<br>
    
    24) What is union?<br>
    A union is a user-defined data type that allows users to store multiple types of data in a single unit. However, a union does not occupy the sum of the memory of all members. It holds the memory of the largest member only.<br> 
    
    25) What is the difference between call by value and call by reference?<br>
    Call by value<br>
    
    Call by Reference<br>
    
    Values of the variable are passed while function calls.	The address of a variable(location of variable) is passed while the function call.<br>
    Dummy variables copy the value of each variable in the function call.	Dummy variables copy the address of actual variables.<br>

    26)What is the sleep() function?<br>
    sleep() function in C allows the users to wait for a current thread for a given amount of time.<br>

    27) What are enumerations?<br>
    In C, enumerations (or enums) are user-defined data types. Enumerations allow integral constants to be named, which makes a program easier to read and maintain.<br>
    
    example : enum week { Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun };<br>
     
    int main()<br>
    {<br>
        enum week day;<br>
        day = Wed;<br>
        printf("%d", day);<br>
        return 0;<br>
    }<br>
    
    28) wheather the number is prime or not ?<br>
    wxample :- int main()<br>
    {<br>
        int num;<br>
        int check = 1;<br>
     
        printf("Enter a number: \n");<br>
        scanf("%d", &num);<br>
     
        // Iterating from 2 to sqrt(num)<br>
        for (int i = 2; i <= sqrt(num); i++) {<br>
            // If the given number is divisible by<br>
            // any number between 2 and n/2 then<br>
            // the given number is not a prime numbe<br>r
            if (num % i == 0) {<br>
                check = 0;<br>
                break;<br>
            }<br>
        }<br>
     
        if (num <= 1) {<br>
            check = 0;<br>
        }<br>
     
        if (check == 1) {<br>
            printf("%d is a prime number", num);<br>
        }<br>
        else {<br>
            printf("%d is not a prime number", num);<br>
        }<br>
    return 0;<br>
    }<br>
    
    29) Explain modifiers.<br>
    Modifiers are keywords that are used to change the meaning of basic data types in C language. They specify the amount of memory that is to be allocated to the variable. There are five data type modifiers in the C programming language:<br>
    
    long<br>
    short<br>
    signed<br>
    unsigned<br>
    long long<br>
